# Generative AI with LLMs â€” Course Practice

This repository contains my notebooks from the **"Generative AI with LLMs"** course by DeepLearning.AI and AWS on Coursera.

This course helped me understand the foundations of working with large language models (LLMs), including:
- LLMs
- Generative AI project lifecycle

- Instruction fine-tuning
- PEFT
- RLHF
